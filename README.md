# Unicode Char Selector

![screenshot of the widget](http://pklaus.github.com/Unicode-Char-Selector/screenshots/screenshot-current.png)

The **Unicode Char Selector** is a widget for the Mac OS X Dashboard. It aims at easy usability to select Unicode chars.
Unicode provides a great way for Signs of all kinds to be organized in a common name scheme. This is why it is worth to remember some of those signs (and maybe their Hex Code). This widget makes it easy to search through the Unicode chars when you have some idea what their hex code might be.

The Dashboard Widget is written using Dashcode. The repository includes the Dashcode project files, so if you want to make changes to the widget feel free and contribute!


## Localisation

Unicode Char Selector is localised in German and English. If you want to contribute another language, do so by opening the project using Dashcode, adding the language and sending me your work (via a git pull request or via email).
