Unicode Char Selector
####################

The Unicode Char Selector aims at easy usability to select Unicode chars.
Unicode provides a great way for Signs of all kinds to be organized in a common name scheme. This is why it is worth to remember some of those signs (and maybe their Hex Code). This Dashboard Widget makes it easy to search through the Unicode chars when you have some idea what their hex code might be.
